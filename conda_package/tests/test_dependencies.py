"""
Tests that the dependency specs in the various files that describe the
``mpas_tools`` package stay consistent with one another.

``recipe/recipe.yaml`` is the source of truth: every package in its
``requirements: run:`` section must show up with the same version constraints
in ``pyproject.toml`` (for those available on PyPI), ``dev-spec.txt`` and
``pixi.toml``.  The latter two are also allowed to list extra packages needed
for development, testing and building the documentation.
